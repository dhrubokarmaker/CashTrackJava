# CashTrack

## Dhrubo Karmaker

**Cash Track** is a Java application aimed to track your weekly expenditure. It tracks all your transactions on a weekly basis. It lets you do things starting from comparing weekly expenses to setting expesne threshold. In short, it was a simple implementation of CRUD.

This project interests me because I find it handy to track my weekly expenses, and I can use it to spend my tutoring
income more efficiently.
