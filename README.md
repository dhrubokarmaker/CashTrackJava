# Expense Tracker

## Dhrubo Karmaker

**Expense Tracker** is a Java application aimed to track your weekly expenditure. It tracks all your purchases of 
current and previous weeks. It lets you set thresholds and checks if you have crossed it. The app is suitable for any
age-group who have started earning and want to keep track of their budget. 

The project interests me because I find it handy to track my weekly expenses, and I can use it to spend my tuition 
income more efficiently.
